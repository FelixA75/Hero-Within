Act III: The Cursed Castle
Depending on your choice:
1.	Entrance 1 or 3: The party faces intricate traps and convoluted mazes, testing your wits and teamwork. Along the way, you uncover more about the prophecy and gather crucial information.
2.	Entrance 2: The collapsed entrance reveals a hidden chamber with a mid-level boss guarding high-level loot. After a challenging battle, the party is rewarded with powerful weapons and artifacts.
Regardless of the chosen entrance, the party eventually reaches the castle's inner sanctum. Here, you encounter the high-level boss, a formidable foe connected to the impending darkness. Armed with newfound loot and knowledge, the party engages in a desperate battle for the fate of the realm.
After all three battles, the trials and quests have strengthened the bonds within your party. Shared victories, challenges, and the looming threat have forged a deep camaraderie, making your group a formidable force against the ancient evil that awaits in the castle's inner sanctum. Success means triumph for your united party, while failure could spell the end for you and your companions, a stark reminder of the unforgiving nature of the dungeons and dragons mythos.
