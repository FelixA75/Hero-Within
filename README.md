# Hero-Within
Simple text rpg game

This program emulates a video/board game franchise known as Dungeons and Dragons or Baldur's Gate. The program will start you of with some sort of story sequences that details how you got where you are. You are then asked to create your character sort of speak. This will include your Name, age and trait. From here, you do as you'd like based on the prompts presented to you.

Instructions:
When first Running the program, take note that a GUI will come up on your screen. This is the first starting point. Click within the window to start the adventure in your shell environment. Follow the prompts to start your journey.
During some of the choices, if you choose the exit game option (or similar) You will need to start over. Best to play through the game without choosing any running/quitting options.


Future work:
If I had more time, I would have fleshed out decision trees a bit better. I also would have added a better battle simmulation using classes instead of using for if statements and while loops.
Another thing I would've loved to add is a save file function and a load file function.
Finally, I would have loved to implement alot of these ideas within the GUI I had created.
