Act I: The Awakening

start1
You wake up in a dimly lit, damp dungeon cell. The air is thick with the stench of mildew, and the distant echoes of clinking chains and guttural growls fill your ears. Clad in simple, tattered clothes, you recall only fragments of your past â€“ a distant battle, a mysterious artifact, and an ancient prophecy. You notice that the barred door on your cell has been broken open.

As you explore the dungeon, you find a rusty key and a worn-out map. Unlocking the cell door, you discover a group of fellow prisoners, each with their reasons for escape. Among them are Kael, a grizzled warrior, Lyra, a sly rogue, and Elara, a wise mage. Together, you form a makeshift party, gathering supplies and weapons from fallen foes.
